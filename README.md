# Tools for formatting IRaMuTeQ data files
[IRaMuTeQ](http://iramuteq.org/) is a programme for algorithmic analysis of text from various sources. It provides resources for Descending Hierarchical Classification of text segments, and for Similarities Analysis.

Unless you are a programmer used to manipulating text, it can be daunting to contemplate typing out the data input files in the format required by IRaMuTeQ. This resource offers a techique for producing the input files using only a spreadsheet program, and a text editor. 

Instructions are provided for treatment of several different kinds of text source documents, including interview transcripts, other kinds of documents, using bibliographic records (where the abstract is the primary source text for analysis), and using verbal responses to questions from survey-type questionnaires.
