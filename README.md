# Tools for formatting IRaMuTeQ data files
[IRaMuTeQ](http://iramuteq.org/) is a programme for algorithmic analysis of text from various sources. It provides resources for Descending Hierarchical Classification of text segments, and for Similarities Analysis.

Unless you are a programmer used to manipulating text, it can be daunting to contemplate typing out the data input files in the format required by IRaMuTeQ. This resource offers a technique for producing the input files using only a spreadsheet program, and a text editor. 

Instructions are provided for treating several different kinds of text source documents including interview transcripts, written and/or printed documents, bibliographic records (where the abstract is the primary source text for analysis), and the verbal responses to questions from survey-type questionnaires.
